If you just want to play the game, you can connect to `leb.derpbox.xyz` in multiplayer on Java Edition.

If you want to create your own LEB server, keep reading.

If you do make your own LEB server, please at least credit me.

### Preperation

* You need Java 16 to be installed before you can proceed, you can find it at [Oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)

### Installation

* Click on [`â¤“ Code`](https://github.com/DBTDerpbox/Legacy-Edition-Battle/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) at the top and download as zip.

* Extract the zip folder

* If for whatever reason, you can't download the resources properly with the current SRP config, you can edit the config inside of the `config` folder and the files can be found [here.](https://github.com/DBTDerpbox/LEB-Resources/tree/zip/zip)

#### Dependencies

* You need to install [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and the following mods:

* [SwitchableResourcePacks](https://github.com/kyrptonaught/SwitchableResourcepacks) ([GitHub](https://github.com/kyrptonaught/SwitchableResourcepacks/releases) [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchableresourcepacks) [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/switchableresourcepacks))

* [scoreboardsuffix](https://github.com/kyrptonaught/scoreboardsuffix) ([GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kyrptonaught/scoreboardsuffix/releases))

* [Extended Structures](https://github.com/kyrptonaught/Extended-Structures) ([GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kyrptonaught/Extended-Structures))

### Executing

#### Windows

* You must get the server jar yourself, you can find it in the minecraft launcher or at [Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server)

* Once you have the server jar, put it inside this folder and name it server.jar

#### MacOS and Linux

* For MacOS users, run macos.sh. You might need to run chmod a+x macos.sh before you have permission to run it.

* For Linux users, run linux.sh. You might need to run chmod +x linux.sh before you have permission to run it.

### Connecting

* For you, the user hosting the server, connect to the address `localhost` in Multiplayer

* If you only want users on your local network to connect, give them your local ip and have them connect to that

* If you want someone from outside your local network to connect, you will need to port forward port `25565` and give the them your public ip to connect to
