If you just want to play the game, you can connect to `leb.derpbox.dev` in multiplayer on Java Edition.

If you want to create your own LEB server, keep reading.

### Preperation

* You need Java 16 to be installed before you can proceed, you can find it at [Oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)

### Installation

* Click on [`â¤“ Code`](https://github.com/DBTDerpbox/Legacy-Edition-Battle/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) at the top and download as zip.

* Extract the zip folder

* If for whatever reason, you cant use the server options to give everyone the resource pack, it can be downloaded from [Here.](https://github.com/DBTDerpbox/LEB-Resources/releases)

### Executing

#### Windows

* You must get the server jar yourself, you can find it in the minecraft launcher or at [Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server)

* Once you have the server jar, put it inside this folder and name it server.jar

#### MacOS and Linux

* For MacOS users, run macos.sh. You might need to run chmod a+x macos.sh before you have permission to run it.

* For Linux users, run linux.sh. You might need to run chmod +x linux.sh before you have permission to run it.

### Connecting

* For you, the user hosting the server, connect to the address `localhost` in Multiplayer

* If you only want users on your local network to connect, give them your local ip and have them connect to that

* If you want someone from outside your local network to connect, you will need to port forward port `25565` and give the them your public ip to connect to
